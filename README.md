# Phase 3 README

## Overview

This project aims to address a critical business challenge faced by our client, a leading sports agency with strategic collaborations within the NBA. The focus is on leveraging data-driven insights to optimize talent management in professional basketball, specifically predicting the likelihood of NBA players remaining in the league for five or more years. The primary objectives include developing a robust predictive model, enhancing talent scouting and recruitment strategies, implementing proactive measures for risk mitigation, and fostering strategic collaborations with NBA teams.

## Business and Data Understanding

### Stakeholder Audience

The primary stakeholders for this project are:

1. **Sports Agency Leadership:** The leadership team seeks actionable insights to make informed decisions regarding player recruitment, resource allocation, and talent development.

2. **Player Agents:** Agents representing NBA players benefit from a predictive model that aids in negotiating contracts and guiding players toward a successful and enduring career.

3. **NBA Teams:** Collaborations with NBA teams are crucial. The insights derived from the model can enhance negotiations, player representation, and strategic planning for both the agency and the teams.

### Dataset Choice

The dataset choice involves a comprehensive collection of data, including player statistics, and other relevant features. The dataset will be curated from reliable sources, ensuring its accuracy and relevance to the predictive modeling objectives.

## Modeling

The core of the project lies in developing a predictive model for NBA player longevity. Key steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.

2. **Feature Selection:** Identifying and selecting relevant features that significantly impact player longevity in the NBA. The Feature of choice was Recall. 

3. **Model Development:** Employing advanced machine learning techniques to build a robust predictive model. Models may include ensemble methods, logistic regression, and decision trees. 

4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's performance. In finalizing the model we used Recall due to the fact it had the 

5. We used a used a decision tree which is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression. We also used logistic regression which estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables.

## Evaluation

The evaluation phase involves a thorough assessment of the developed predictive model. Key aspects include:

1. **Model Performance:** From the base model to the final model we imporves our recall by 5%. <img width="377" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-06 at 1 11 54 PM" src="https://github.com/makmula/phasethree/assets/141356197/79d0541f-cc17-4872-b8fe-5d30111007df">
